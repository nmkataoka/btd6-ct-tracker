# BTD6 Contested Territory Tracker

For tracking stuff in CT.

##

TODO:
- debug /available command finding existing message and editing it
- debug expiring soon returning 'none'
- consider formatting dates a little better with h, m, s. Maybe HH:MM:SS to match CT?
- locally test
- get a channel to start testing for real
- try hosting on lightsail
